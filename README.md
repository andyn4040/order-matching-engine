# Order Matching Engine
This repository contains the implementation of an order matching engine designed for financial trading systems. The engine efficiently handles the submission, matching, and execution of buy and sell orders while ensuring data integrity and high performance.

# Features
- Real-Time Order Matching: Matches buy and sell orders based on price and time priority.
- PostgreSQL Integration: Utilizes PostgreSQL for persistent storage of orders and trade history.
- REST API: Provides a set of endpoints for order submission, order book retrieval, and trade history.
- Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle increasing loads with the potential for optimizations using in-memory caching and message queues.
- Security Features: Implements JWT authentication to secure API access.

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone this repository and follow the setup instructions in the README.
